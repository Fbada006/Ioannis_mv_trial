        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
            its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
        </p>

        <p>This is how you declare variables</p>
        <p>
            <code>
                var x = 42.
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>
                var x = 42.
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                var x = 42.
